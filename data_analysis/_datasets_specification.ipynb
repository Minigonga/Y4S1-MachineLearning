    "# WNBA Season Business and Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes 10 years of WNBA data, including player, team, coach, and game statistics. Basketball seasons are structured in two phases: a regular season, where teams compete to maximize wins, and a playoff stage, where top teams face off in knockout matches for the championship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insights extracted for strategic relevance:**\n",
    "- Teams with high roster turnover are more likely to change coaches.  \n",
    "- Players with consistent top-tier performance across multiple metrics are more likely to win individual awards.  \n",
    "- Defensive metrics and win consistency are strong predictors of regular-season rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of business goals\n",
    "The business objectives for predicting the upcoming WNBA season are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predict the final regular-season conference rankings of each team**  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify teams likely to change coaches**  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Predict winners of individual awards**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic rationale:**\n",
    "- Accurate prediction of rankings informs team performance analysis and fan engagement strategies.  \n",
    "- Anticipating coaching changes allows for studying team stability and potential strategic interventions.  \n",
    "- Forecasting individual awards highlights key player contributions and supports marketing or talent evaluation simulations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Translation of business goals into data mining goals\n",
    "Each business goal has been mapped to specific **predictive modeling objectives**, with algorithmic approach, features, and evaluation metrics explicitly defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Teams likely to change coaches → Classification**\n",
    "   - **Model type:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Logistic Regression.  \n",
    "   - **Features:** team win/loss records, roster turnover, coach tenure, historical coaching changes, performance trends.  \n",
    "   - **Evaluation metrics:** accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall.  \n",
    "   - **Insight-driven refinement:** feature importance analysis to determine which variables most influence coaching changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predict winners of individual awards → Ranking / Regression**\n",
    "   - **Model type:** Ranking models (e.g., XGBoost ranking) or regression predicting award points.  \n",
    "   - **Features:** player performance metrics (points, rebounds, assists, efficiency ratings), consistency across seasons, team success.  \n",
    "   - **Evaluation metrics:** top-3 ranking accuracy, Spearman correlation with actual awards.  \n",
    "   - **Insight-driven refinement:** analyze correlations between metrics and award likelihood to improve model interpretability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regular-season conference rankings → Regression / Ranking**\n",
    "   - **Model type:** Regression or ranking models to predict final standings.  \n",
    "   - **Features:** team statistics (offensive/defensive efficiency, win streaks, home/away performance), player averages, coaching stability.  \n",
    "   - **Evaluation metrics:** ranking error, RMSE between predicted and actual standings.  \n",
    "   - **Insight-driven refinement:** incorporate ensemble methods and cross-validation to increase prediction robustness.  \n"
